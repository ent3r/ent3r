Hey! My name is S1LV3R! I am a student in Norway, and I'm part of a CTF team called [Team Corax](https://corax.team). We are the 3rd best team in Norway!

I also do a lot of programming in my free time. I mostly program in node.js, HTML+CSS, JavaScript, and python. I also use frameworks every now and then. Mainly Vue.js.

I have also made a couple websites using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

### A couple cool things I've created:

- A repo with different python templates (flask, logging, tkinter, etc): [ent3r/Python-templates](https://github.com/ent3r/Python-templates)
- A "framework" for a discord bot made in node.js using discord.js: [ent3r/JADB](https://github.com/ent3r/JADB)
- A theme switcher made in HTML, CSS, and JS: [ent3r-s-projects/theme-switcher](https://github.com/ent3r-s-projects/theme-switcher)
- A discord RFC bot made in node.js that automatically responds with an RFC spec. if it detects it in a message: [ent3r-s-projects/discord-rfc-bot](https://github.com/ent3r-s-projects/discord-rfc-bot)

### Projects im working on and stuff (idk):

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on a small project for publishing text snippets, almost like twitter, except with the ability to EDIT SNIPPETS!
  The backend repo is https://github.com/ent3r/mevn-stack-server, the frontend repo will be https://github.com/ent3r/mevn-stack-client when i actually remember to create it.
 

- üå± I‚Äôm currently (trying to) learn Vue.js to make the page mentioned above.
