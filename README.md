## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=ent3r.ent3r)

My name is ent3r! I am a student in Norway, and I'm part of a CTF team called [Team Corax](https://corax.team). We are the 3rd best team in Norway!

I also do a lot of programming in my free time. I mostly program in node.js, HTML+CSS, JavaScript, and python.

### A couple cool things I've created:

- A repo with different python templates (flask, logging, tkinter, etc): [ent3r/Python-templates](https://github.com/ent3r/Python-templates)
- A "framework" for a discord bot made in node.js using discord.js: [ent3r/JADB](https://github.com/ent3r/JADB)
- A theme switcher made in HTML, CSS, and JS: [ent3r-s-projects/theme-switcher](https://github.com/ent3r-s-projects/theme-switcher)
- A discord RFC bot made in node.js that automatically responds with an RFC spec. if it detects it in a message: [ent3r-s-projects/discord-rfc-bot](https://github.com/ent3r-s-projects/discord-rfc-bot)

### Projects im working on and stuff (idk):

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an extensive project to make a login and auth page using OAuth2, email+password login, MongoDB for storage, "Keep me logged in" system, and a website made with Vue.js
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vue.js to make the page mentioned above
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with making the "Keep me logged in" system mentioned above
