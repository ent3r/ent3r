Hey! My name is S1LV3R! I am a student in Norway, and I'm part of a CTF team called [Team Corax](https://corax.team). We are the 3rd best team in Norway!

I also do a lot of programming in my free time. I mostly program in node.js, HTML+CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python. I also use frameworks every now and then, primarily Vue.js.

I have also made a couple websites using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), including my [personal website](https://s1lv3r.codes).
