Hey! My name is S1LV3R! I am a student in Norway, and I'm part of a CTF team called [Team Corax](https://corax.team). We are the 3rd best team in Norway!

I also do a lot of programming in my free time. I mostly program in node.js, HTML+CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python. I also use frameworks every now and then, primarily Vue.js.

I have also made a couple websites using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

### A couple cool things I've created:

- A repo with different python templates (flask, logging, tkinter, etc): [theS1LV3R/Python-templates](https://github.com/theS1LV3R/Python-templates)
- A "framework" for a discord bot made in node.js using discord.js: [theS1LV3R/JADB](https://github.com/theS1LV3R/JADB)
- A theme switcher made in HTML, CSS, and JS: [theS1LV3R-s-projects/theme-switcher](https://github.com/theS1LV3R-s-projects/theme-switcher)
- A discord RFC bot made in node.js that automatically responds with an RFC spec. if it detects it in a message: [theS1LV3R-s-projects/discord-rfc-bot](https://github.com/theS1LV3R-s-projects/discord-rfc-bot)

### Projects im working on and stuff (idk):

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [CTFNote](https://github.com/CTFNote), a platform for taking notes for CTF's. The backend is made in express.js, and the frontend is made in Vue.js
